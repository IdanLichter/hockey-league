-- Telemetry: one append-only event stream for web + iOS + Android.
--
-- Why this exists: the bug class that keeps biting this project is INVISIBLE to the
-- Supabase edge logs. A Swift decode that throws, a runCatching that swallows a 403,
-- a React render that white-screens — every one of those is a clean HTTP 200 (or a
-- request that never leaves the device) and shows up nowhere. The only place that
-- knows is the client, so the client has to say so.
--
-- Data lives here, not in a third party: these events carry role and screen context
-- for accounts belonging to minors, and that stays inside the project's own database.
