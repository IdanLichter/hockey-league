/**
 * Fill the league's blank refereeing form with a played game and return it as .xlsx
 * bytes — the same sheet the judge fills by hand, printed out already knowing what
 * happened.
 *
 * The form is a fixed drawing: two team blocks of ten player rows each, a fouls grid
 * and a timeout box down the right of each, then results at the bottom. We only ever
 * WRITE INTO cells the form already has, so every value inherits the border, font and
 * fill the original was drawn with. Two things are structural rather than cosmetic:
 *
 *  - A squad can exceed the ten printed rows, so the player block grows. New rows are
 *    spliced in just BEFORE the block's closing row (which carries the bottom border)
 *    and their U:Y cells are left out entirely — that region is the timeout box, and
 *    empty rows there read as space between the two halves rather than a torn grid.
 *  - The medic section the form has no room for is appended after the last row, built
 *    from the results section's own title/label/value rows so it looks native.
 *
 * Everything the app cannot know stays exactly as printed: the team-foul grids, the
 * timeout minutes, and every signature line.
