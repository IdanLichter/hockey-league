 * project's history: a 403 from a column-level grant, and a row-level policy quietly
 * returning nothing. Both are HTTP-visible here and invisible everywhere else, because
 * callers wrap them in try/catch or `.catch(() => [])` and carry on looking healthy.
 *
 * It is also where "what did users actually DO" comes from. Every write the app makes
 * is a POST/PATCH/DELETE through here, so the action log builds itself — no call site
 * has to remember to report, and none can drift out of date. Successful READS are not
 * recorded: they are high-volume, they are already in the edge log, and page views
 * answer that question better.
