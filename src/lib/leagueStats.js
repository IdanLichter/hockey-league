/**
 * League-wide statistical derivations for the Statistics page.
 *
 * Every export here is a PURE, side-effect-free function of its arguments so it
 * can be unit-tested in isolation. No React, no fetching, no globals.
 *
 * DATA CAVEATS baked into these functions (verified against production):
 *  - Team-level series (goals over time, goal race, goal difference) are sourced
 *    from the `games` table, because ALL 45 completed games carry scores there.
 *  - Player-level series (hat-tricks, braces, big games) come from `game_stats`,
 *    which only exists for 40 of the 45 completed games — the other 5 never will.
 *    Anything derived from game_stats must be presented with that "40 מתוך 45"
 *    caveat in the UI. Season *totals* per player still live on players.goals and
 *    are authoritative; we never recompute those here.
 *  - `game_date` is a timestamptz STRING like "2025-09-27 13:30:00+00". We slice
 *    the month/date straight off the string rather than going through `Date`, so
 *    our month buckets line up with the DB's UTC `::date` grouping and never
 *    drift with the viewer's local timezone.
 *  - April 2026 has ZERO games — a real mid-season gap. `seasonMonths` emits it
 *    so the timeline renders it as an empty month instead of silently closing up.
 *  - game_stats.clean_sheet is all-false in prod and yellow_cards is unused —
 *    never read them. Clean sheets are derived from game scores.
