 * React binding for the GameEngine. Instantiates one engine per game (mapping the
 * DB home/away teams onto the engine's home/guest), restores any localStorage
 * draft, drives a ~20fps tick while the clock/break is live, and re-renders on
 * every engine change. Persists a draft (at most once a second) so a refresh
 * mid-game loses nothing.
 *
 * If this browser has NO local draft but the game is still live on the server
 * (the judge officiated from another device, or storage was cleared), it
 * rehydrates the engine from the last broadcast snapshot instead of starting
 * fresh — otherwise the next tap would reset a match the whole league is watching.
