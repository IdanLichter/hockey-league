/**
 * Everything the game-form export needs to know about a played game, assembled from
 * what the app actually recorded.
 *
 * The one real question here is who belongs on each team's block, because the answer
 * changed over the life of the app. Three sources, best first:
 *
 *   1. the game squad — who declared for THIS game, plus anyone a coach or judge
 *      added by hand. Only games played since squads shipped have it.
 *   2. whoever has a game_stats row — the judge's box score. Not a lineup, but every
 *      player in it demonstrably took part, and it covers 41 of the 51 played games.
 *   3. the team roster, for older games with neither. Wider than a real lineup; the
 *      alternative is handing back a sheet with no players on it at all.
 *
 * Guest players are the gap: a judge's free-text guest carries a name and the team
 * they came FROM, never the side they played for, so nothing here can place them.
 * They come back as `guests` for the export dialog to assign.
